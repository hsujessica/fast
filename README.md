## What were the most difficult tasks?

- deciding how I wanted to store the user's selection in state
- using CSS to align and center page elements in a clean way

## Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?

- difference between event.currentTarget versus event.target
- updating state object required using bracket notation for key, could not use dot notation

## What did you not have time to add? What work took the up majority of your time?

Did not have time to-

- add cookies or session storage
- write tests

Styling and designing the app took the most time

## How could the application be improved?

- implement a back-end that handles requests and hides the API key from users
- using cookies so that a user can have persistent data upon returning
- add routing
- display to the user what is already added to their list before they confirm
- if results were very long, possibly paginate
- additional accessibility functionality
